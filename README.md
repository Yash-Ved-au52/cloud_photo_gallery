[Project : Cloud Photo Gallery ] 

Introduction: The Cloud Photo Gallery project is a web application 
that allows users to upload, store, and manage their photos in the 
cloud. The application provides a user-friendly interface for uploading 
photos, adding titles or captions, searching for photos by title, 
submitting feedback, and supports authentication using JWT (JSON Web 
Tokens) for enhanced security. It utilizes technologies such as Express.js, 
MongoDB, Cloudinary, JWT, and Bootstrap to deliver a seamless user 
experience.

Objectives: 
1. Allow users to sign up and log in to the application securely using 
JWT authentication. 
2. Provide an intuitive interface for users to upload photos with titles 
or captions. 
3. Implement a search functionality to find photos based on their titles. 
4. Store user data and photos securely in a cloud-based database. 
5. Ensure responsiveness and a visually appealing design using 
Bootstrap. 

Technologies Used :  
1. Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js, used for 
routing and handling HTTP requests. 
2. MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing user information and 
photos. 
3. Cloudinary: A cloud-based media management platform for 
storing and managing uploaded photos. 
4. Multer: A middleware for handling multipart/form-data, used for 
photo uploads. 
5. JWT (JSON Web Tokens): A secure method for authentication and 
authorization in web applications. 
6. Bootstrap: A front-end framework for creating responsive and 
visually appealing web pages. 
7. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Standard web development 
technologies for creating the user interface and interactivity. 
System Architecture:  
The system architecture of the Cloud Photo Gallery project follows a 
client-server model. The client-side is implemented using HTML, CSS, 
and JavaScript, while the server-side is built using Express.js. MongoDB 
is used as the database for storing user information and photos, and 
JWT is employed for user authentication and authorization. 

Features and Functionality: 
1. User Registration and Authentication: Users can sign up for an 
account and log in securely using JWT authentication. 
2. Photo Upload: Users can upload photos, add titles or captions to 
them, and save them to the cloud. 
3. Photo Search: Users can search for photos based on their titles. 
5. User Profile: Users can view their profile information, including 
their name and email address. 
6. Logout: Users can log out of the application to ensure security.
